        <p>On May 14, 2014, the Golden State Warriors named Steve Kerr
          the team's head coach in a reported $25 million deal over five
          years. It is a first-time head-coaching position for Kerr, 48,
          a five-time NBA champion point guard who holds the all-time career
          record for accuracy in three-point shooting (.454). Kerr formerly
          served as president and general manager for the Phoenix Suns
          basketball team (2007 to 2010), and had most recently been working
          as an NBA broadcast analyst for Turner Network Television (TNT).
          In the 2014â€“15 season, they finished a franchise-best 67-15 as Stephen
          Curry was named MVP. In the playoffs, the Warriors swept New Orleans
          in the first round, then defeated Memphis in 6 and Houston in 5 to win
          the Western Conference championship. The Warriors advanced to their
          first Finals since 1975, playing against the Cleveland Cavaliers.
          After trailing 2-1, Golden State won the next 3 and the championship
          4-2. Andre Iguodala, despite not starting any game before the Finals
          series, was named the Finals MVP.
          The next year they set the record for most regular season wins in NBA
          history. They started the season 24-0. The beat the Rockets 4-1 in the
          first round despite the fact that Steph Curry only played 2 games in
          the series because of ankle and knee injuries. They beat the Portland
          Trailblazers 4-1 in the next round. Curry missed the first 3 games the
          knee injury suffered against the Rockets. They went 2-1 without him.
          He returned with a 40-point performance off the bench and they won
          game 5. They then fell behind 3-1 in the Western Conference Finals to
          the Oklahoma City Thunder before rallying to win three straight games
          and advance to the NBA Finals for the second straight year against the
          Cleveland Cavaliers. The Warriors jumped out to a 3-1 series lead.
          However, Game 5 with the turning point as the Warriors lost at home
          with Draymond Green being suspended for striking LeBron James in the
          groin. The Cavs won that game and game 6 in Cleveland to force a game
          7. The Warriors lost game 7 93-89 at Oracle Arena.</p>

        <p>After their Finals loss, they acquired former Most Valuable Player
          Kevin Durant of Oklahoma City in free agency.</p>
