pip install Django :  installation of Django using pip
pip list: list installed packages
pip install Django: command to install Django. The information was showing the installation of Django in the terminal.
pip freeze (What's the difference between freeze and list?) Output installed packages in requirements format. The difference between pip list and pip freeze is that pip list shows a list of installed packages in the computer and pip freeze shows a list of packages that you want to maybe uninstall.
First cd into your Desktop directory (cd ~/Desktop), then run this command: pip freeze > requirements.txt. What do you see when you ls? What's inside this file? I see a list of folders//files in my Desktop which is also in the requirements.txt file.
pip uninstall Django: uninstall the Django package.
pip show Django: gives the properties of the Django package.
pip search Flask: searches for the Flask package and lists the files in the Flask package.
